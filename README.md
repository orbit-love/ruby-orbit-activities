> This is a Ruby gem that can be included in any Ruby application to take care of the logic of interacting with the Orbit API to create custom activities.

<hr />

## Package Usage

### Installation

To install this integration in a standalone app, add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "orbit_activities"
```

Then, run `bundle install` from your terminal.

### Send Custom Activity

To send a custom activity to Orbit using the gem, instantiate a new instance of the `Request` class:

```ruby
OrbitActivities::Request.new(
    api_key: # Your Orbit API key,
    workspace_id: # Your Orbit workspace ID,
    body: # The custom activity object
)
```

For details on the data structure the Orbit API expects for a custom activity object, refer to the [Orbit API Documentation](https://docs.orbit.love/reference#post_-workspace-id-activities).
